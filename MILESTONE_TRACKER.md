# 🏁 Milestone Tracker - Workflo Website Evolution

## Purpose
Track every major version of the website so we can always roll back to a working state without starting from scratch.

- Graceful degradation if components fail
**Improvements from Complex**:

npm run build
git add -A && git commit -m "Rollback to basic failsafe"
git push
```

### To Enhanced (Beautiful + Safe):
```bash
cp app/page.tsx app/page-current-backup.tsx
cp app/page-enhanced.tsx app/page.tsx
npm run build

## 🎯 Current Strategy

1. **Now**: Using Basic (100% reliable but plain)
2. **Next**: Test Enhanced (beautiful + safe)
3. **Goal**: Make Enhanced production-ready
4. **Future**: Gradually add Complex features with proper failsafes

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Breaks Sites:
1. Missing environment variables
2. Context providers not initialized
3. Browser APIs used during SSR
4. External data dependencies
5. Complex component chains

### What Makes Sites Reliable:
1. Hardcoded fallbacks for everything
2. Dynamic imports with loading states
3. Try-catch around risky operations
4. Progressive enhancement
5. Graceful degradation

---

## 🚀 Next Actions

1. **Test Enhanced Version Locally**:
```bash
cp app/page-enhanced.tsx app/page.tsx
npm run dev
# Test all features
```

2. **Build Test**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# Check production build
```

3. **Deploy Enhanced**:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Deploy enhanced version with failsafes"
git push
```

4. **Monitor**: Check https://nextsite.workflo.it after deploy

---

## 🔐 Safety Rules

Before deploying ANY version:
1. ✅ Run `npm run build` - must succeed
2. ✅ Run `npm run typecheck` - must pass
3. ✅ Test locally with `npm run start`
4. ✅ Have a rollback plan ready
5. ✅ Know which milestone you're on
